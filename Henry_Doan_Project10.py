# Project 10

# In this project we are going to calculate several values for each player. 
# One is the aforementioned batting average.
# A second calculated value is called the slugging percentage.
# This value is found as follows: (1*Singles + 2*Doubles + 3*Triples + 4*HomeRuns)/AB.
# Our data does not provide the number of singles directly but it does tell us the number of
# hits from which we can subtract the number of doubles,
# triples, and home runs to get to the number of singles.
# Additionally, you will need to calculate the overall batting average for all 25
# players combined. Note that this is different than the mean batting average of the 25 players.
# After all calculations are performed,
# create a nicely formatted report (and send it to an output file)
# that shows the top five players for each of the 6 individually calculated values.
# Additionally, include in this report the overall batting average for all 25 players combined.
