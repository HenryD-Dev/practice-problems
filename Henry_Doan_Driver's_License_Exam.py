# Project 8 part 1
# The local driver’s license office has asked you to create an application
# that grades the written portion of the driver’s license exam.
# The exam has 20 multiple-choice questions.
# Your program should store these correct answers in a list.
# The program should read the student’s answers
# for each of the 20 questions from a text file and store the answers in another list.
# It should then display the total number of correctly answered questions,
# the total number of incorrectly answered questions,
# and a list showing the question numbers of the incorrectly answered questions.
